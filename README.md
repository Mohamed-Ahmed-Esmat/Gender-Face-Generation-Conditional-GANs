# CGAN Faces - Gender Classification using Conditional GANs

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to generate facial images based on gender. The model is trained using the "Gender Classification Dataset" from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The notebook utilizes the [Gender Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset), which contains a collection of images labeled by gender. The dataset is automatically downloaded and extracted using the Kaggle API.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Kaggle API (configured with your credentials)

### Python Libraries

- `kaggle`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install kaggle tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
